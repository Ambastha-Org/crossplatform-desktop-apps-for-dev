        ### 🌟 New Tool Proposal
        Thank you for contributing! Our goal is to map tools that exist on both **Windows** and **macOS** to help developers stay consistent across platforms.

        ⚠️ **Important:** To maintain a clean registry, our bot will automatically scan for duplicates. If the tool or ID already exists, this issue will be **automatically closed** with a reference to the existing entry.
